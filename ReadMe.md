We have chosen the Norwegian Airlines stock prediction use case.

We belive it would be best to do this use case using a linear regression algorithm.
The reason why we have chosen this is because we are looking at a linear model where
there is a constant relationship between time and price. And in this assignment we are 
looking for a specific price at a specific time, where the date is the input 
and the closing price of the stock is the output.
